# Ames-Housing-Price-Prediction

This repository contains all the data and code used to build a machine learning web app to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa. 

Click [here](link pending) to access the app.

The prediction model running on the web app ranks in the top 8% of Kaggle's [House Price Prediction Competition leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) and top 1% of [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course/overview) (as of 10/27/2021).

Kaggle notebook outlining the model building process is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ruthgn/house-prices-top-8-featengineering-xgb-optuna/notebook).

The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.
